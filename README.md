# Photon-Racer
Photon Racer is a two player racing game developed in Unity  

## Gameplay
This project uses Photon, a Unity package for multiplayer games. Each player is able to race eachother on different devices in a session that is hosted locally. Flexible matchmaking gets the players into rooms where objects, coins and the vehicle position in this case, can be synced over the network.
